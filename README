5-DESIGN DECISIONS & ISSUES
---------
Design Decisions:

Major Issues:

Minor Issues:
having an issue on occassion were my program does not seem to terminate correctly, I am trying to figure out why/root cause.
ctrl-c is required to return to the command line when this happens. I believe it has something to do with my child processes terminations when cleaning up.
